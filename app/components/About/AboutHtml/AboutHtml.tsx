            Hello! I am a fifth-year medical student with a passion for web
            development. Over the past two years, I have dedicated myself to
            studying full-stack web development, creating innovative solutions
            with cutting-edge technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey in web development has equipped me with a diverse skill
            set, including front-end and back-end technologies. I am proficient
            in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. On the front end, I
            have worked extensively with frameworks and libraries such as React,
            Next.js, Framer Motion, and Three.js, leveraging Tailwind CSS for
            efficient styling.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the back end, I have experience with Node.js, Express, and Django
            REST Framework (DRF), along with databases like PostgreSQL. I am
            also familiar with Java and am currently diving deeper into Spring
            Boot.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my coding skills, I have explored containerization
            with Docker and Kubernetes, and I am good at using design tools like
            Figma. My knowledge extends to working with Apache Kafka for
            real-time data processing.
            <br />
            <br />I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals
            and contributing to innovative projects that make a difference.
